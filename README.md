## Basic Rules

### **Board Setup:**
- The game is played on an 8x8 grid.
- Each player starts with two discs of their color placed diagonally at the center.

### **Turns:**
- Players take turns placing one disc of their color on an empty square.
- A valid move must "sandwich" at least one opponent's disc between two of the player's own discs, in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction.

### **Flipping Discs:**
- When a player surrounds the opponent's discs on opposite sides, all enclosed discs flip to the player's color.

### **Passing:**
- If a player has no legal moves, they must pass, and the opponent continues to play.

### **End of the Game:**
- The game ends when the board is full or when neither player can make a legal move.

### **Winning:**
- The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game wins.
- In case of a tie (both players have an equal number of discs), the game ends in a draw.

## Execution

### **Board Initialization:**

- The user is presented with a menu with the following options:

  1. View Team Members

### **Game Setup:**
- Players enter their names (`p1` and `p2`).
- The initial board is displayed using the `show()` function.
- A loop begins for turn-based gameplay.

### **Game Turns:**
- Each turn consists of:
  - The current player inputting a row and column for their move.
  - Move validation using `menu_x()` or `menu_o()`.
  - Updating and displaying the board.
  - The game continues until a player chooses to exit.

### **Game Completion:**
